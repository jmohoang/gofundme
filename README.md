# Survival Analysis of Crowdfunding Campaigns 

In this project, we examined multiple
survival analysis models to investigate the
determinants of the duration of a crowdfunding
campaign. We used gofundme.com as our case
study and tested five hypotheses related to the data
available. These hypotheses examine the
assumption that the length of the campaign is
dependent on the category it’s listed under,
whether or not it was created in December’s
holiday period, the financial goal of the campaign,
the number of times the campaign was shared on
social media and the sentiment of the description
accompanying the campaign.
